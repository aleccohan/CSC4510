# CSC4510
>Programming Language Design and Translation. A study of the various programming language paradigms and basic program language translation. Emphasis will be on run-time behavior, lexical analysis, parsing context-free languages, translation specifications, and machine-independent code improvement. Each student will participate in programming projects to demonstrate various concepts

## Projects

### Project 1
* Project 1 was primarily based on learning to write the same program in different languages and understanding how bash scripts can greatly improve the process of testing programs with different data sets. 

### Project 2
* Project 2 focused on how parameter passing, scoping rules, and aliases work in C++ and Java and how the two languages handle both similarly or differently.  

### BC
* BC is a multi-part assignment that looks at the linux **B**asic **C**alculator and recreating it

#### BC1
* BC1 is a simplified version of the calculator that was used to show how to use Lex and Yacc 

#### BC2
* BC2 takes BC1 and adds the rest of the operators involved with the Basic Calculator and organizes the data better by using a symbol table managed by hashing each variable.
